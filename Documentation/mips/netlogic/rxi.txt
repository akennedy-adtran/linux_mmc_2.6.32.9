NetLogic's XLP processor provides support for inhibit reading and executing 
of portions of applications address space. In the absence of read and exec 
inhibit semantics, the address space could only be write-protected while the 
whole address space is readable and executable, a security hole. The 
archiectural support/enhancement now allows the application of all the three 
permission modes (read, write, execution) in all combinations to the address 
space of application.

Read and Exec inhibit semantics can be configured indepedently in Linux 
during compile time as follows:

> make menuconfig

    Machine selection  --->
        ...
        [*] Enable Read Inhibit Semantics
        [*] Enable Exec Inhibit Semantics
