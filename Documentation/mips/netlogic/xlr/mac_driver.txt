drivers/net/xlr_mac.c

The source for both gmac and xgmac driver is in the above file. The below
xlr specific linux command line arguments can be used to configure the linux
at boot time.

xls_gmac0_sgmii=1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On XLS systems, by default, RGMII is used for port 0. To use SGMII, this
option needs to be passed at boot time.

xlr_msgring_thread_mask=<4-bit bit mask specifying threads in a core>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This can be used to specify the configure the bitmask of threads to which the
message ring interrupt of a core should rounb-robin'ed.

The default value is 0xf.  Please see msgring.txt for further details.

xlr_complete_msgring_thread_mask=<32-bit value bit mask to enable threads in each core>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This can be used to specify which threads in the core will get interrupted when message
is recieved.

Please see msgring.txt for further details.

xlr_msgring_watermark=<0...255>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This can be used to specify a watermark for the message ring buckets in the
cpu core. A value higher than the number of credits from a tx station to the
cpu may cause some performance problems as the interrupt would only be
delivered on a timeout

There is no message ring watermark timeout supported by the hardware. Instead,
one of the PIC system timers is used to deliver a 1ms timer interrupt for this
purpose.

The most optimal watermark value is 8. The default value is 1.

xlr_mac_desc=<4...2048>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This can be used to specify the number of free descriptors per gmac interface
to be used. Accordingly, the spill areas are configured. A higher number is
not necessarily better because the cpus may not keep up with high traffic
throughput and the packets are dropped in the software instead of at the
mac interface.

The default value is 512.

xlr_napi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enables NAPI polling mode on GMAC/XGMAC drivers. Option is disabled by default.
This option also enables another optimization: it sets lockless tx mode 
(NETIF_F_LLTX) on the interfaces and turns off use of the default pfifo_fast 
interface transmit queue in the stack (by setting tx_queue_len to 0). With 32
vcpus, the cost of synchronizing the transmit interface queue using the pfifo_fast
discipline is pretty high. Since the transmit of packets to the mac on XLR is 
via message ring on which multiple agents can transmit message simultaneously 
lockless tx helps to avoid locks in the generic driver.

If intention is to co-exist GMAC/XGMAC NAPI polling loop with processing messages sent by 
non-GMAC/XGMAC stations (e.g. Security, Compression, DMA) then special option has to be 
enabled in the kernel:

  make menuconfig
         -->Machine Selection
	    [*] Demultiplex messages from on-chip devices inside NAPI poll loop 

  exit saving kernel config, execute "make clean && make"

XLR_NAPI option requires xls_msgring_thread_mask to match user_mask_cpus: E.g. if
linux is booted with "userapp_mask_cpus 0x33333333" then linux kernel option
"xlr_msgring_thread_mask=0x03" must be passed to the kernel.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get the best performance for networking benchmarks like routing, please
use the following options while booting linux with all hardware threads.

"xlr_msgring_thread_mask=0x0f xlr_napi"
