Please make sure mips64-unknown-linux-gnu- toolchain is in the path. 
The new  toolchain could be found in 

/opt/rmi/<release>/mipscross/nptl/bin.

To build the kernel for ATX-I/ATX-II/ATX-III:

There is a default .config, so there is no need to do a 'make menuconfig', 
unless the kernel is being configured differently.

$ make vmlinux
