Nand and nor flash mtd jffs2 support is enabled by default.

Linux sees the NOR flash as a single partitions:
0M-8M - used by bootloader. Linux should not touch.
8M-end of the flash(16M) - partition 0.

Linux sees the NAND flash as two partitions:
0M-8M - used by bootloader. Linux should not touch.
8M-62M - partition 1.
62M-end of the flash - partition 2.

Nor flash jffs2 partition 0 is named as "User FS". 
Nand flash jffs2 partition 0 is named as "Root Filesystem" and 
Nand flash jffs2 partition 1 is named as "Home Filesystem".

Nand and Nor can be mounted as follows:
Major block number of mtd(nand and nor) block devices is  31.
It can be confirmed by issuing the command: ls -l /dev/mtdblock* 

If NOR flash is present minor number 0 is alloted to nor jffs2 partition 0.
Nand flash partitions will have minor numbers 1 and 2.
In case of only Nand flash minor numbers 0 and 1 will be alloted to nand jffs2
parittions.

By default only /dev/mtdblock0 is created.
Create additional devices(if needed) by issuing the command:
mknod /dev/mtdblock1 b 31 1
mknod /dev/mtdblock2 b 31 2

Information about the minor numbers of the mtd partitions can be obtained by
issuing the command: cat /proc/mtd

Linux can write boot images into one of these partitions once it is mounted as 
a jffs2 file system.

mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock0 <mount point>
mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock1 <mount point>
mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock2 <mount point>

Writing image into this partition is the only way to create jffs2 files into the
nand/nor flash partition. jffs2 present in bootloader is readonly.

2. jffs2 and nand/nor mtd support in bootloader:
============================================

nand mtd and jffs2 are ported from u-boot code. Added support for micron in the 
mtd. 

Nor is statically divided into many partitions as follows:

0M-(4MB-128k): primary bootloader
(4M-128K)-(4M+128K): env
(4M+128K)-(8M): backup bootloader
8M-end of the flash(16M): jffs2 nor partition 0(user FS)

Nand is statically divided into many partitions as follows:

0M-(4MB-128k): primary bootloader
(4M-128K)-(4M+128K): env
(4M+128K)-(8M): backup bootloader(only boot2 in case of nand)
8M-62M: jffs2 nand partition 0 (Root Filesystem)
62M-end of flash: jffs2 nand partition 1 (Home Filesystem)

         Files are written into jffs2 partitions by linux. Same configuration in
         terms of size and location of partition needs to be maintained 
         between linux and bootloader. This is a readonly partition in case of 
         bootloader.

Commands like

    dls nor0 0 <filename>
    dls nand0 0 <filename>
    dload nand0 0 <filename>

can be used by bootloader to list/load files from nand flash.
