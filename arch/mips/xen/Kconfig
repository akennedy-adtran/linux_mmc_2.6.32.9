config XEN
	bool "Xen guest support"
	select PARAVIRT
	select PARAVIRT_CLOCK
	depends on NLM_XLR || NLM_XLP
	help
	  This is the Linux Xen port.  Enabling this will allow the
	  kernel to boot in a paravirtualized environment under the
	  Xen hypervisor.

config XEN_DEBUG_FS
	bool "Enable Xen debug and tuning parameters in debugfs"
	depends on XEN && DEBUG_FS
	default n
	help
	  Enable statistics output and various tuning options in debugfs.
	  Enabling this option may incur a significant performance overhead.

config XEN_DOM0
	bool "Enable Xen privileged domain support"
	depends on XEN
	help
	  The Xen hypervisor requires a privileged domain ("dom0") to
	  actually manage the machine, provide devices drivers, etc.
	  This option enables dom0 support.  A dom0 kernel can also
	  run as an unprivileged domU kernel, or a kernel running
	  native on bare hardware.

# Dummy symbol since people have come to rely on the PRIVILEGED_GUEST
# name in tools.

	def_bool XEN_DOM0
