config MMC_CLKGATE
	bool "MMC host clock gating"
	depends on !CPU_XLP
	help
	  This will attempt to aggressively gate the clock to the MMC card.
	  This is done to save power due to gating off the logic and bus
	  noise when the MMC card is not in use. Your host driver has to
	  support handling this in order for it to be of any use.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_USE_SLOT_GPIO

	default y if !CPU_XLP
